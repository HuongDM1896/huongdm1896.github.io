**ABSTRACT** In recent years, computation offloading has become an effective solution for limited resource issues. This article investigates decision offloading and computing resource allocation. We propose a task offloading framework to minimize the total delay considering the resource condition in the MEC federation system. Then, we also solve this problem by transferring to Markov Decision Process (MDP) and using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework. Simulation results show that the DDPG can successfully lower the delay of the tasks.
