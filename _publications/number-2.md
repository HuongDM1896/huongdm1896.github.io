**ABSTRACT** In the last year, Augmented Reality (AR) applications have used computationally intensive vision algorithms on devices with low resources. Computation offloading has shown to be an effective solution for resource constraints. We propose an AR sub-tasks offloading framework based on the AR service's sub-tasks dependency model to reduce the end-to-end latency in the MEC federation system while taking resource situation into account. The problem is then solved by switching to the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) model. The simulation findings suggest that the DDPG can successfully reduce the AR task latency.
