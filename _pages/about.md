**Xin chào, tớ là Mai Hương.**  
**Hello, I'm Mai.**  
**Bonjour C'est Mai.**  
**안녕하세요 Mai 입니다.**

I come from Vietnam, a small but beautiful country in Asia. My academic journey has taken me from my homeland to South Korea and now to France.

I earned my B.S. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/) in 2020, where I was supervised by Dr. Lâm Hồng Thạch. In 2024, I completed my M.S. degree in Computer Science at [ANDA Lab](https://anda-researchers.github.io/site/team/), Soongsil University under the guidance of Prof. Myung Sik Yoo. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. and working as a member of the SEPIA team at [IRIT Lab](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/), Univeristy of Toulouse under the supervision of [Prof/HDR. Georges Da Costa](https://www.irit.fr/~Georges.Da-Costa/) and [Assoc.Prof/MCF. Millian Poquet](https://mpoquet.github.io/).

At present, my work focuses on distributed computing systems, energy consumption, and federated learning.

Know me in my works
======
- **Distributed computing system, energy measurement, federated learning**: These are my current research topics, so I’d like to discuss them if we share similar interests.

- **Deep reinforcement learning, optimization modelling, edge computing**: These were the focus of my master’s research. While I am not deeply involved in them at the moment, they are still relevant to my current work. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to exchange ideas!

- **Antennas, radio frequencies, wireless communications**: I worked in these areas in the past. Although they are no longer my primary focus, I still enjoy keeping up with updates and discussions in these fields.

Know me beyond my works
======
- I enjoy hiking, listening to music, traveling, and I have a great passion for delicious food.

- My personal motto is: "*Follow your heart's desires.*" Then my heart said, "*Eat, Relax, and Wait to grow old.*"
