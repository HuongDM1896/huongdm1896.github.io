### My academic journey

My academic journey has taken me from my homeland to South Korea and now to France.
I earned my B.S. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/) in 2020, where I was supervised by Dr. Lâm Hồng Thạch.  
In 2024, I completed my M.S. degree in Computer Science at [ANDA Lab](https://anda-researchers.github.io/site/team/), Soongsil University under the guidance of Prof. Myung Sik Yoo.  
Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. and working as a member of the SEPIA team at [IRIT Lab](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/), University of Toulouse under the supervision of [Prof. Georges Da Costa](https://www.irit.fr/~Georges.Da-Costa/) and [Assoc. Prof. Millian Poquet](https://mpoquet.github.io/).
At present, my work focuses on distributed computing systems, energy consumption, and federated learning.

## 🔬 Know me in my works

- **Distributed computing system, energy measurement, federated learning**  
  These are my current research topics, so I’d like to discuss them if we share similar interests.

- **Deep reinforcement learning, optimization modelling, edge computing**  
  These were the focus of my master’s research. While I am not deeply involved in them at the moment, they are still relevant to my current work.

- **Antennas, radio frequencies, wireless communications**  
  I worked in these areas in the past. Although they are no longer my primary focus, I still enjoy keeping up with updates and discussions in these fields.

## 🌱 Know me beyond my works

- I enjoy hiking, listening to music, traveling, and I have a great passion for delicious food.
- My personal motto is: "*Follow your heart's desires.*"  
  Then my heart said, "*Eat, Relax, and Wait to grow old.*"
